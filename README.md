# Cafe Menu

This is a simple static web page that showcases a cafe menu for the "Camper Cafe." It displays available coffee and dessert options, along with their prices, in an attractive layout. The project is styled using CSS and includes background images, custom fonts, and layout adjustments.

## Demo

You can see the working example by opening the `index.html` file in your browser.

## Features

- **Responsive Design**: The page is responsive and adjusts well to different screen sizes.
- **Menu Sections**: The menu is divided into two categories: Coffee and Desserts.
- **Interactive Links**: Includes links that change color when hovered or clicked.
- **Images**: Displays images related to coffee and desserts.

## Structure

### HTML (index.html)

- The main structure of the page is created with semantic HTML elements such as `<main>`, `<section>`, and `<article>`.
- Two sections are defined: "Coffee" and "Desserts", each containing a list of items and their prices.
- A footer includes a link to the website and an address.
  
### CSS (coffeeMenu.css)

- **Background**: The body background consists of a beans image (`url(https://cdn.freecodecamp.org/curriculum/css-cafe/beans.jpg)`).
- **Typography**: The page uses the `Impact` font for headings and `sans-serif` for other text.
- **Centered Layout**: The menu is centered using `margin: auto;` and has a fixed maximum width of 500px to maintain readability.
- **Images**: Images for coffee and desserts are included in the menu and centered using `display: block` and `margin: auto`.
- **Interactive Styling**: Links change color when hovered over, visited, or clicked.
